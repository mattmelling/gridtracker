gridtracker (1.20.0922) buster; urgency=medium

  The old method of creating/editing/copying a GridTracker.desktop
  file has been deprecated, instead, we install one in /usr/share/applications,
  which means that GridTracker will be available via the usual linux menu system..

  If you'd also like a desktop icon, simply:
        cd $HOME
        rm -f Desktop/GridTracker.desktop
        ln -s /usr/share/applications/gridtracker.desktop Desktop/GridTracker.desktop
