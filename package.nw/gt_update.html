Fixes:
  Right-click on empty grid flickering
  
Update:
  Call Roster:
    Band and Mode columns added to the right-click menu
     when enabled columns remain sticky
     when not enabled columns appear automatically as needed 

    US Counties:
      Counties are "best guess" based on the zipcode of the station
       the roster will rotate in unworked then unconfirmed counties as needed
        until I can get a database of US Callsigns with county info
   
  Window(s):
    For "Energy Star" complaint monitors that shutdown to save power
      position of window(s) restored on return of display
        does not work if you close GridTracker when a display is off

  Lookups:
    Added "DXCC" worked/confirmed status by band below last "QSO" date
  
  Lookup and Chat windows now scale too!
    ctrl-minus / ctrl-plus / reset with ctrl-zero
  
















Thank you for reading the entire update!
