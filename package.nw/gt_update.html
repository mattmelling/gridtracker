Thank you for reading the entire update! 











Mention "phone-sofa" in any forum I read and I'll send you a GridTracker token
to the address associated with your callsign lookup

Please don't mention this easter-egg to anyone. I want to see who reads the update

To the 21 of you out of 650-ish, who downloaded and read the update in v1.20.0819: 
	I salute you! And I'll be shipping out tokens when I get a chance! Thank you!
