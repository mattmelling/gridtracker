[v1.20.0819] August 19th, 2020

Callable Roster:
	New:
		"Window Always On Top" option in Settings -> "Call Roster"
			default disabled
			
		Award Tracker!
			Click on "Logbook" and select "Award Tracker"
			Click "Add Awards" and select your sponsor and award name
			
			Hover over the award indicator to get quick-stats
			quick-stats is a place holder until I get the stats tab built
			
			Award Tracking is 'best guess'. confirm with your award sponsor the
			validity of your logbooks, GridTracker will try its best but could
			be wrong
			
			Award tally may be incorrect or incomplete, we are working on it
			
			Not every award is available yet for tracking
			
			Special thanks to NR0Q and KB2YSI for compiling awards definitions
			
			At this time IOTA is processed but not a trackable field (yet)
		
		US County (Wanted , Column, Right-Click Menu)
			If US callsign database is enabled, best guess on stations county
		
		Continent (Wanted , Column, Right-Click Menu)
			Why did I not have this sooner?!
	
		Changed "No Round-up and "Only Round-up" to "No" and "Only" Decode Message
			If "No" or "Only" are checked, then the decoded message is checked
			You can enter any thing you want (Grid, Callsign, CQ target)
			The fields also support regex, but not required
			
		Compact Mode - Great for Contesting!!!
			Right-click menu, "Compact Mode" only shows callsigns
			The order is the order of the last column sorted in "Roster Mode"
			I *will* be improving this in future releases!
		
		Text Sizing
			Ctrl-0(zero) resets text size to default value
				
	Update:
		"Reference" renamed "Logbook" with "Logbook Reference" tooltip
		Added Spot report to tooltip in Spot column
	
Logbook Reference:
	Fixed:
		Turkey Region 1 now in Europe
		
Lookups:
	Update:
		Display previous worked and confirmed by band
	
Legend:
	Update:
		Button moved from map settings back to the button panel


Thank you for reading the entire update! 










Mention "phone-sofa" in any forum I read and I'll send you a GridTracker token
to the address associated with your callsign lookup

Please don't mention this easter-egg to anyone. I want to see who reads the update
