GridTracker:
  I have improved the UI/UX (User interface/User Experience) in this release
  I have moved buttons around &amp; items are labeled for clarity
  Most items/buttons that you can interact with have a tooltip
  Simply hover your mouse-pointer over an item/field/button &amp; it will describe it

Main Window:
  Update:
    "Call Roster + Award Tracker" Text button now a 
      "Call Roster + Award" Icon button
      
    "Lookup" Icon button less creepy
    
  New:
    "?" Icon button toggles the Hotkey List
      In the next release it will open documentation
      
    "Timezone" Icon button toggles Timezone layer
    
    "Radar" Icon button toggles US Nexrad Weather layer

Hotkey List:
  Ordered by Key for clarity
  Added Version to header
  
Map:  
  Fixed:
    "Timezone" layer very slow to react 
  
Settings:
  Update:
    Merged Spots Tab with Map Tab to make room for Logbook Tab
      
  Logbook:
    New Tab!:
      "Working Callsign(s)"
        When enabled, filter your logbooks by callsigns
          (eg:"N0TTL,N0OAW,KE0PEA") only those callsigns will be loaded
    
      "Working Date"
        When enabled, filter your logbooks by date
          (Only QSO on or after date will be loaded)
		  (Dates are 00:00:00 UTC/Zulu)
      
      When "Apply Changes" is pressed, GridTracker will re-import logs
        (it may take a while)
    
  Lookups:
    Update:
      Callsign Database now list instead of boxes
        Making room for more callsign databases
          NR0Q found the Canadian call-db and will be in a future release
          
      Downloads are now automatic and weekly when enabled
        The US Database is only 10mb
        
    US Callsign Database:
      Fixed:
        Corrupt/Incomplete database due to program close while downloading

Call Roster:
  Fixed:
    Hide Controls/Show Controls getting out of sync when switching views
